This tool also generates a statistical report on the use of HTML tags.


- The labels are automatically detected by means of regular expressions.

## Tip: Compile multiple files in a single big one

In order make a quick validation on multiple files you can compile all the individual files in a single one and upload that file to the tool.

- **Pros**: You can quickly validate a large number of files in a single report.
- **Cons**: You will not know in which file is the specific missing tag.

### Windows

1. Open a [CLI] windows on the parent folder containing all the files to compile.
2. Run this command: 
```
$ copy *.htm compiled_list.txt
```
3. All the files with **HTM** extension will be compiled inside the new file **compiled_list.txt**.
4. Upload **compiled_list.txt** file to the tool.
5. Done!

### Mac
